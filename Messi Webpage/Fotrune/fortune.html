        <div class="col-md-4">Messi's new contract is reportedly worth a net £500,000 (€565,000) a week. It's difficult to compare exactly due to different tax rules and bonuses, but he is probably the second-highest paid player in Europe behind Neymar.

        Before signing this deal, Messi was estimated to be on around £336,000. 
        
        Only two footballers outside of Europe earn more than Messi and Neymar: Carlos Tevez and Ezequiel Lavezzi, who play in the cash-rich Chinese Super League.</div>
        <div class="col-md-4">Ironically, Messi has Neymar to thank for his new and improved terms. His departure to Paris Saint-Germain not only brought Barca a massive windfall but also took his wages off the books.

        Before that - when club president Josep Maria Bartomeu was insisting a deal had been agreed despite the fact that it had not been signed - Barca had admitted that Messi's new salary would take their wage spending above what is generally recommended by UEFA.
        
        "The LFP and UEFA make recommendations but nobody sets a salary cap," Bartomeu said. "We are above what is recommended but the important thing is to be sustainable. We can afford it."</div>

            Celebrity Net Worth estimates that Lionel Messi's net worth is an astonishing $400 million. Currently the highest paid soccer player along with his impressive endorsement deals, he was ranked by Forbes as the second highest-paid athlete in the world in 2018.

            Unlike other footballers, the five-time Ballon d’Or winner doesn’t choose to spend his money on casinos, race horses and other indulgences.

            Instead, the 30-year-old Argentine forward focuses on charity work – which is centred mainly on kids.
            This charity streak is no doubt a reflection of his own troubled childhood – in which he had nightly injections between 11 to 14 years old to battle his growth hormone deficiency and strengthen his legs.

            After a 2007 visit to a hospital for terminally ill children, Messi started his own foundation (The Lionel Messi Foundation) to fund medical research and centres worldwide.
