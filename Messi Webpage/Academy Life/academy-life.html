                    <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6">Messi burst on the scene in 2004, as the Argentina international made his Barcelona debut against local rivals Espanyol.And as the world now recognises Messi amongst the likes of football royalty in Pele and Diego Maradona, it's easy to forget the hard work the 29-year-old put in while plying his trade in the club's La Masia academy.

                    Thankfully, Barcelona have reminded us today of exactly what Messi could do when he was just 16, with footage which the club claims has never seen the light of day... until now:
                    Since graduating from the club's fabled youth set-up, Messi has written his name into the history books at Barcelona, becoming the club's all-time leading goalscorer in 2012.

                    <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6">Hailing from Rosario, he had arrived in Barcelona just two years earlier and turned up in the Infantil B (Infantil is the Under-12 youth category in Spanish youth football) dressing room "without us even hearing him say hello", another defender, Robert Franch, remembers.

                    In the youth teams at Barcelona, the new arrivals are always asked the same question. "Where do you play?," Rodolf Borrell asked Messi in front of the whole team in February 2002. Without lifting his look from the floor, Leo replied in a quiet voice. "As a forward," he muttered, before taking him off to a corner where he sat in silence.

                    <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6">After a fast progression through Barcelona's youth academy, Messi made his competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. Despite being injury-prone during his early career, he established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, finishing 2007 as a finalist for both the Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year award, a feat he repeated the following year. His first uninterrupted campaign came in the 2008–09 season, during which he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football. At 22 years old, Messi won the Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year award by record voting margins.

                    <div class="col-xs-6 col-sm-6">Three successful seasons followed, with Messi winning three consecutive FIFA Ballons d'Or, including an unprecedented fourth. His best campaign statistically to date was the 2011–12 season, in which he set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a single season, while establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer in official competitions in March 2012. The following two seasons, Messi finished twice second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo, his perceived career rival. Messi regained his best form during the 2014–15 campaign, breaking the all-time goalscoring records in both La Liga and the Champions League in November 2014,[note 3] and led Barcelona to a historic second treble.

                      Eight years ago, they were three boys with dreams. But even the imaginations of those supremely gifted 15-year-olds would have struggled to foresee a moment as emotive or arresting as the scenario due to play out on Wednesday evening in London.

                    The team photograph, taken in 2002, tells so much of the story. Lionel Messi, the slightest among the group, is caught speaking to a team-mate when his attention ought to be on the camera. Cesc Fabregas, also distracted, his face unmistakable. Gerard Pique, towering over many of his peers, shaping into the defender who won the Champions League last year. At FC Barcelona, in the youth teams as much as with the seniors, standards are high – but it comes as little surprise that this group of players, with a spine of future world-beaters, are still referred to with reverence as the "Baby Dream Team".
