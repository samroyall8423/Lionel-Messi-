                              <p class="card-text">Four-times World Player of the Year, Messi is already Barcelona's record goalscorer. Although not an out-and-out striker, he operates in Barcelona's front three and in the 2011-12 campaign he set a new world record by scoring 73 times in a single season. Messi also dovetails beautifully with his Barca team-mates, and is a hard worker to boot. However, his indifferent form for Argentina means he has often borne the brunt of criticism from the fans and media. He went some way towards mending the relationship with some inspired displays at the 2014 World Cup, but fell just short of leading his country to glory.</p>

                              <p class="card-text">If you're looking for the best soccer player in the world, there are few finer sights than Lionel Messi using a mixture of pace and trickery to beat multiple defenders from his position in the center of the Barcelona attack.


                                    Pele and Maradona are considered by many to be the best players ever to have kicked a ball, but it is no exaggeration to say that Messi has now claimed a position alongside these players in soccer's pantheon of greats.
                                    
                                    
                                    The Argentinean joined Barcelona at the age of 13, with the club paying for treatment on a growth hormone deficiency that threatened to stunt his progress. What a shrewd investment that now looks, with Messi already the club's record goalscorer.</p>
